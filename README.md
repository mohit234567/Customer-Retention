# Customer-Retention

During my virtual Power BI internship with Forage in collaboration with PwC, I undertook an exciting project focused on developing a comprehensive Customer Retention Dashboard. This project aimed to leverage the power of Power BI to analyze and visualize customer data, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights and devise strategies to improve customer retention rates.

The Customer Retention Dashboard provides a centralized platform for monitoring and evaluating key metrics and indicators related to customer retention. By integrating data from various sources such as customer transactions, interactions, and feedback, the dashboard offers a holistic view of customer behavior and helps businesses identify factors influencing customer churn.

The main objectives of this project were to:

Track Customer Retention Metrics: The dashboard presents essential metrics such as customer churn rate, customer lifetime value, repeat purchase rate, and customer satisfaction scores. These metrics enable businesses to monitor customer retention trends and assess the effectiveness of customer retention strategies.

Identify Factors Impacting Churn: By utilizing advanced analytics capabilities within Power BI, the dashboard helps identify key factors influencing customer churn. It provides insights into customer demographics, purchase patterns, and customer touchpoints, enabling businesses to pinpoint areas where improvements can be made to retain customers.

Visualize Data for Insights: The Customer Retention Dashboard utilizes interactive visualizations, including charts, graphs, and heatmaps, to present data in a visually appealing and intuitive manner. This allows users to explore data from different perspectives, identify patterns, and gain actionable insights to drive customer retention efforts.

Segment Customer Groups: The dashboard incorporates segmentation capabilities to analyze customer behavior based on various attributes such as age, location, purchase history, and product preferences. This segmentation empowers businesses to personalize their retention strategies and target specific customer groups with tailored campaigns and initiatives.

Throughout the project, I utilized my technical expertise in Power BI to design and develop a user-friendly and dynamic dashboard. I leveraged data modeling techniques to integrate disparate data sources, implemented data cleansing and transformation processes to ensure data accuracy, and employed data visualization best practices to create compelling and informative visuals.
